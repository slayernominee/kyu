# Kyu

an alternative git client for the command line written in rust

this project is just for fun and nothing serios, use it at your own risk

the work was heavily inspired by the wyag tutorial (https://wyag.thb.lt/#checkout) which implements a git client in python

i used following crates for this project:

chrono
clap
colored
flate2
hex-literal
rust-ini
sha1

and of course the standard library

all rights for the crates & rust belong to the respective owners / contributors
and the idea itself and the steps and ideas belong to the wyag tutorial

many thanks :)
