# Kyu

an alternative git client for the command line written in rust

this project is just for fun and nothing serios, use it at your own risk

## Credits

This whole project is heavily inspired by the wyag tutorial (https://wyag.thb.lt) which is a tutorial about implementing a git client in python
The idea itself is not mine, i just wanted to try to implement it in rust.
Also the concepts are from the tutorial and the complete know how on how git works (at least i learned it from there first)

So many thanks to the author of the great tutorial for the super interesting learning experience :)
